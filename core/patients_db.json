She has often felt self-conscious about her facial symmetry. Despite being highly successful in her career, she has avoided orthodontic treatment in the past due to both financial constraints and a busy lifestyle. Recently, Monica has begun experiencing discomfort in her jaw, particularly when chewing tougher foods.\n\nOver the years, she has maintained a healthy lifestyle but occasionally deals with anxiety regarding her appearance. Monica is single and actively engaged in social events, frequently hosting dinners for her friends. Her close bond with her best friend, Rachel, provides her a valuable support system. Monica's desire for personal improvement paired with her professional background makes her an ideal candidate for orthodontic evaluation and potential treatment."
